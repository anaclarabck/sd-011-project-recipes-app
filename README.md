### What we developed

Recipe app, using React ecosystem: Hooks and Context API, and styling with the [Bootstrap] library (https://react-bootstrap.github.io/). We developed its functionalities as a group according to the defined demands, which were:

- View, search, filter, favorite, and follow the process of preparing recipes and drinks.
- Use two separate APIs, one for [food](https://www.themealdb.com/) and one for [drinks](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php).
- The layout focuses on mobile devices, so all prototypes should be developed for smaller screens.
